# DSP-Labs
This is a repo containing the labs from my Digital Signal Processing Class. The code here is written in Matlab 
and it was mostly editted and written by me from samples that our professor provided. We worked in teams on these labs
and my partners would type up the lab write up which is also found in the repo.
